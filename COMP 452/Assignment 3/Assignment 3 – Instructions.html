<h2>Minimaxing and Learning</h2>
<p>This assignment is worth 30% of your final grade. Submit it after you have completed Unit 9.</p>
<h3>Game 1: Minimaxing (50 marks)</h3>
<p>The objective of this program is to implement a “Connect 4” board game with two players: a user and a computer. The board should have 7&nbsp;columns and 6&nbsp;rows. The user plays with white chips and the computer plays with black chips.</p>
<p>Suppose that the board is placed in a vertical position and the players introduce chips at the top of a chosen column. The board is under the influence of gravity, and each chip always falls to the lowest available row in the column. The player with white chips goes first, and then the players take turns placing one chip at a time into the board game. The first player who is successful in creating a connected line of 4&nbsp;chips on the board—horizontally, vertically or diagonally—is the winner. [Figure&nbsp;1 illustrates four white chips in a row diagonally, resulting in a win.] If the board is full and no player has won, then the game ends in a tie.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>It is recommended that you implement alpha–beta pruning and set a limit for depth cut off for the minimax game tree search for the black chips (computer). For example, if you specify a depth cut off of&nbsp;4, the player with the black chips is only allowed to build the game tree 4&nbsp;rows deep into the board.</p>

<h3>Game 2: Learning (50 marks)</h3>
<p>The objective of this program is to implement a learning technique in a game of your choice. You can either implement a simple new game or use one you have already implemented in Assignment&nbsp;1 or Assignment&nbsp;2. You may use the source code from a game you find on the Internet as long as you clearly reference the original creator and source <em>and</em> you implement the learning algorithm by yourself.</p>
<p>Choose any learning algorithm from the ones we examined in this course (hill climbing, N-gram, ID3, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Q-learning,</span> etc.). If you are interested in implementing a learning algorithm not covered in the course, please contact your instructor to obtain permission first.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Extra credits up to 15% will be given to students who choose to implement a new game. No mark will be deduced for those who choose to use one of their games implemented in previous assignments.</p>

<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>
<p>For each game, submit the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Java source code files</li>
<li>an executable file for your game (.jar, .exe., etc.)</li>
<li>any sound files used in your program</li>
<li>any textures or images used in your program</li>
<li>a description file containing the following information:
<ul>
<li>a description of the logic and design of your game</li>
<li>instructions on how to compile/run your game</li>
<li>a list of any bugs or problems in your game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marking</h3>
<p>Your overall grade for each game is based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulfillment of the requirement that your program be a working game <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(20 marks)</span></li>
<li>creativity (5 marks)</li>
<li>inclusion of a description file that contains details about the design and implementation of your game. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(20 marks)</span></li>
<li>Good code design and style: is your coding consistent, readable, commented and modularized? <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(5 marks)</span></li>
</ul>
