<h2>Pathfinding and Decision-Making</h2>
<p>This assignment is worth 20% of your final grade. Submit it after you have completed Unit 6.</p>
<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<h4 class="no-space-above">Game 1: A* Pathfinding (50 Marks)</h4>
<p>The objective of this program is to implement a game with a tiled search area that has obstacles. The search area is a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">16 × 16 grid</span> with some obstacles, a start point and a goal point. The robot character (an&nbsp;ant) should find its way from the start point (home) to the goal point (food) with minimal costs. The search area has different types of terrains with different cost values, as specified in the following&nbsp;table:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: auto; border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); border-style: solid; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Open Terrain</td>
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cost = 1</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Grassland</td>
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cost = 3</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Swampland</td>
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cost = 4</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Obstacles</td>
<td style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not applicable</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Your program must allow the user to specify the grid configuration at the beginning of each run. The user will have to specify the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>the start and the goal cells</li>
<li>the obstacle cells</li>
<li>the nature of the terrain for each cell</li>
</ul>
<p>Your program must also allow the user to see visually the path search evolution from the start point to the goal point.</p>
<h4>Game 2: Finite State Machine <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(50 marks)</span></h4>
<p>The objective of this program is to implement a game simulating the behaviour of ants. The ants should be designed based on the logic that their purpose is to collect food and return to their home position. The ants have to follow certain obstacles and rules in the simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ants move randomly in their environment in an attempt to locate a piece of food.</li>
<li>When an ant finds a piece of food, it returns to its home position. You can implement the path to its home position as you wish.</li>
<li>When an ant arrives home, it (a) becomes thirsty, (b) drops its food, and (c) starts a search for drinking water.</li>
<li>Ants looking for water roam randomly in their environment in their attempt to find water.</li>
<li>When an ant finds water, it drinks and then resumes its search for food.</li>
<li>New ants are born in the colony. Every time an ant returns food to the home position, a new ant is added (born) to the team that will start a search for&nbsp;food.</li>
<li>The ant population continues to grow as long as more food is brought home.</li>
<li>The environment is a grilled area with cells that may be of different types: empty ground, food, water or poison.</li>
<li>Food, water and poison are randomly placed in the environment.</li>
<li>Ants can walk safely on empty ground, food and water cells; however, any ant that steps on a poison cell must die. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The only thing the user has to specify is the starting number of ants in the colony. Food, water and poison should be generated and randomly distributed by the program.</li>
<li>Ants must be roaming randomly when looking for food or water; otherwise, use your creativity to implement other movements (i.e., returning to the home position).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission Requirements</h3>
<p>For each game, submit the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Java source code files</li>
<li>an executable file for your game (.jar, .exe., etc.)</li>
<li>any sound files used in your program</li>
<li>any textures or images used in your program</li>
<li>a description file containing the following information:
<ul>
<li>a description of the logic and design of your game</li>
<li>instructions on how to compile/run your game</li>
<li>a description of the state machine (for Game&nbsp;2 only)</li>
<li>a list of any bugs or problems in your game</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marking</h3>
<p>Your overall grade for each game is based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>fulfillment of the requirement that your program be a working game <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(20 marks)</span></li>
<li>creativity (5 marks)</li>
<li>inclusion of a description file that contains details about the design and implementation of your game. <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(20 marks)</span></li>
<li>Good code design and style: is your coding consistent, readable, commented and modularized? <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(5 marks)</span></li>
</ul>
